# READ ME!

This is a subfolder in a repository that I have used for my CS-410: Operating Systems class at carroll college. I am aware that it was bad practice to put multiple "projects" into one repository; however, I was not at the time.

This is a basic hello world program which runs on the Apache ANT software build tool. The purpose of this project was to learn (and/or create a template for) ANT build files.
